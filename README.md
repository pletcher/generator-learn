Learn JavaScript Lab Generator
---

This [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator provides a basic scaffold for JavaScript-based labs on [Learn.co](https://learn.co/). It by default, it fills in the following with your configuration and spits out

- .editorconfig
- .gitignore
- .learn
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- index.js
- LICENSE.md
- package.json
- README.md
- test/index-test.js

It'll `npm install` some stuff (including `jsdom` and `mocha-jsdom` if you're writing a browser-based lab) to boot.
